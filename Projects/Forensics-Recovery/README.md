Project: Forensic Recovery & Integrity ValidationRole: Digital Forensics Analyst (Simulation)Platform: Kali LinuxTools: Foremost, dd, md5sum, mount1. Executive SummaryThis project demonstrates the ability to perform File Carving and Data Integrity Validation on a seized storage medium. I simulated a scenario where a suspect deleted a sensitive PDF document from a storage device. Using forensic techniques, I bypassed the OS file system to recover the raw data and proved its authenticity using cryptographic hashing.2. Technical MethodologyPhase 1: Evidence Creation & AcquisitionTo simulate a seized device, I created a 50MB raw disk image and formatted it with an ext4 filesystem. I then "plugged in" this virtual drive by mounting it to my local filesystem.Disk Image Creation: dd if=/dev/zero of=suspect_drive.img bs=1M count=50Filesystem Setup: mkfs.ext4 suspect_drive.imgPhase 2: Establishing Chain of Custody (Hashing)Before the file was deleted, I calculated its MD5 Hash. In a real-world investigation, this acts as the "digital fingerprint" required to prove that the evidence recovered later is identical to the original and has not been tampered with.Phase 3: Anti-Forensic SimulationThe file was deleted using the rm command. This removes the file's pointer in the filesystem's index (making it invisible to the OS), but the raw data blocks remain on the disk until overwritten.Deletion Command: sudo rm mnt_point/evidence.pdfPhase 4: Forensic CarvingI used Foremost, a forensic program used to recover files based on their headers and footers (Magic Bytes). By scanning the raw binary of suspect_drive.img, Foremost identified the PDF headers and extracted the file even though it was "deleted."Carving Command: foremost -t pdf -i suspect_drive.img -o recovery_results3. Results & ValidationThe recovery was successful. To validate the integrity of the recovered artifact, I compared the MD5 hash of the original file with the carved file.ArtifactMD5 Hash ValueOriginal File (Step 6)[2942bfabb3d05332b66eb128e0842cff]Recovered File (Step 9)[2942bfabb3d05332b66eb128e0842cff]Conclusion: The hashes match exactly. This proves that the data was recovered with 100% integrity, maintaining forenesic standards for evidence.
